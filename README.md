# Feedback-and-Control-ECE311
MATLAB scripts that cover different aspects of making and tuning controllers

This repository stores code I produced in 2015 while taking ECE-311, Feedback and Control, at Portland State University. There are some homework problems, and some scripts that I wrote just to get a hang of the subject matter.
